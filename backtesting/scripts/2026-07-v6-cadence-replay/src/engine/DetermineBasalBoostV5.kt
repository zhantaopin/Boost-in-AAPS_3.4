/**
 * Boost V5 algorithm core — Observe-Confirm-Commit pipeline orchestrator.
 *
 * Status: PRODUCTION — this is the dosing core behind the selectable "Boost V6" plugin
 * (header corrected 2026-07-02; previously said PRE-ALPHA from the shadow era). Phase 1.a
 * (meal_signal_score), 1.b (state machine), 1.c (AggressionBudget), 2 (action multiplier), and
 * 3 (safety gates) live in their respective files; the orchestrator below stitches them into the
 * single `decide()` entry point, wired from oref/Boost services by OpenAPSBoostV5Plugin.
 *
 * Architecture (mirrors `boost_v5_redesign_proposal.md` exactly):
 *
 *   Phase 1 — state estimation (no commitment):
 *     - mealSignalScore          (MealSignalScore.kt)
 *     - step + resetIfNeeded     (MealHypothesis.kt)
 *     - aggressionBudget         (AggressionBudget.kt)
 *
 *   Phase 2 — single decision rule:
 *     - mealActionMultiplier(state) × budget   (MealActionMultiplier.kt)
 *
 *   Phase 3 — ordered safety gates:
 *     - applyPhase3              (SafetyGates.kt)
 *
 * `baseInsulinReq` MUST come from Boost-flavoured oref calc (DynISF + 7D TDD with W8H pull-down +
 * TDD-anchored EMA sensitivity + autosens + hour-of-day ISF + TempTargets — all unchanged).
 * V5 contains zero sensitivity logic of its own. See `MIGRATION.md` and the AggressionBudget
 * KDoc for the full inheritance contract.

 *
 * This floor is unique: when delivered it must OUT-DOSE V1 in a non-meal state (V1 also doses ~0
 * when insulinReq ≤ 0), so the caller flags the cycle exempt from the override seam's non-meal cap.
 * The exposure is bounded to ONE routine hold — target = min(tier, committedCap) — and the caller
 * additionally clamps to maxIOB headroom + pump rounding (NOT the dynamic spike cap, which is
 * 2.5×baseInsulinReq ≈ 0 here and would wrongly zero the floor). It NEVER bypasses a Phase-3 HARD
 * gate (returns 0.0 when one fired) nor the cumulative-60min / boost-active / sleep / post-rescue
 * seam guards (all upstream of the exemption). PER-USER opt-in + fail-closed 14d-TBR gate only
 * (BooleanKey.ApsBoostV5VelocityBudgetActive ∧ composedFloorTbrAllowed) — it deliberately overrides
 * a prediction that was right-by-outcome on the shadow data, justified only by low hypo exposure.
 *
 * Conditions (ALL): state ≠ RECOVERING ∧ bg > 180 ∧ budget ≤ 0.01 ∧ !asleep ∧ !postRescueWindow.
 * - RECOVERING is EXCLUDED: dosing into a decelerating high is the RECOVERING-SMB pattern rejected
 *   2026-07-03 (adds into a high-IOB tail → lows).
 * - Deliberately NOT gated on "rising": the 2026-07-17 sizing showed the rising (delta>3) sub-cell
 *   is crash-prone (10.7% pre-low, n=28) while the sustained high tail prices under the base rate
 *   (4.3% vs 5.8%). Sustained-high is the safer target than sharp-rise.
