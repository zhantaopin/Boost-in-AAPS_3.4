Semi-closed-loop insulin-perturbation replay — shared library.

Approach (Tim's design): keep each user's OBSERVED glucose trace (it already contains the real
unannounced meals). Replay a candidate dosing model; where its dose DIFFERS from what actually ran,
perturb the trajectory by the insulin-action difference (oref exponential activity × DynISF-at-the-
time), and let the model RE-DOSE on the perturbed trace (semi-closed-loop). No carb model → sidesteps
the ReplayBG unannounced-meal problem; the only thing modelled is the insulin delta, via known
pharmacology + the clinical/DynISF sensitivity (not the non-identified fitted SI).

VALIDITY: first-order in the dose delta (softens for large perturbations); DynISF held at its observed
value; mlMealLikely held observed. FIDELITY-GATED: the port must reproduce logged doses first.
