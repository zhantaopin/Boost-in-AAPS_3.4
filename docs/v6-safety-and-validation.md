# Boost V6 — safety, "no training" & validation

*Detail page. See the [main README](../README.md) for the overview. The full data-analysis method
and tooling live on the [backtesting page](../backtesting/README.md); this page gives the
essentials and the honest evidence picture.*

## There is no training loop in the dose path

This is the point people most often get wrong about Boost, so it is stated plainly:

- **The dose decision is a deterministic, rule-based state machine.** It is *not* a model trained to
  output insulin, and nothing in it learns online. Given the same inputs it produces the same dose,
  and every branch is readable in source.
- **Two small trained models feed the decision; neither outputs insulin.** Both are gradient-boosted
  trees trained offline on other people's records, validated with participants held out, and
  shipped as fixed trees that run on the phone. The hypo-risk score throttles the aggression budget
  and can only ever *reduce* delivery. The meal-likelihood score can *increase* it, on three paths:
  it carries a weight of 0.20 in the meal-confirm score, so a high score can confirm a meal earlier
  and bring the larger doses sooner; above 0.50 it releases the base engine's pre-meal hold on its
  four aggressive tiers; and above 0.30 it keeps the sleep detector from classifying you as asleep,
  which keeps overnight restraint off. Every dose that follows still passes the same caps and gates,
  and in non-meal states Boost stays capped at what the base engine would do; those limits, not the
  model, bound what it can cause. See
  [the methods report](../backtesting/reports/2026-09_boost_lgbm_methods.md).
- **Personalisation ≠ training.** Auto-config and the learned baselines derive *suggestions* from
  your own history — they tune settings, they do not learn the dose.
- **Validation is replay on real history, not curve-fitting.** Candidate changes are scored against
  real recorded decisions before any dosing code ships — there is no parameter sweep optimising a
  glucose objective on the same data, which is exactly how dosing algorithms overfit.

## Why changing a dosing algorithm is treated as a clinical-equivalence problem

Users co-adapt to an algorithm's behaviour (manual pre-boluses, knob settings, meal habits). A
"correct" fix can make control *worse* until the user re-adapts. So every change is classified before
it ships, following a published taxonomy of safe algorithm updates in automated insulin delivery
(*"Safe Algorithm Updates in Automated Insulin Delivery Systems"* — see the backtesting page for the
full citation):

| class | meaning | how it is treated |
|---|---|---|
| **Factual** | objective, wrong-by-computation | fix immediately (e.g. an inverted knob, a null-returning method) |
| **Heuristic** | co-adapted with the user's behaviour | transition gradually, shadow-first (e.g. dose aggressiveness, meal-confirm timing) |
| **Computational** | numeric / port differences | verify equivalence (e.g. the Android↔Trio port) |

**The bar:** a change should be *clinically equivalent or better* — validated on real history —
before it doses for anyone. Two rules fall out: don't flash an unvalidated dosing change right
before the user is away (if it can't be watched, it doesn't ship — unless it's pure shadow); and
shadow-first for anything heuristic.

## The backtesting toolkit

All scripts read Nightscout `devicestatus`, which already logs paired outputs (the actual dose,
the V6 shadow/active decision, and a `base would=` counterfactual), so they reconstruct decisions
from data we already have rather than re-implementing the algorithm.

| script | what it answers |
|---|---|
| **`shadow_equivalence.py`** | Per-component agreement/divergence between two algorithm paths — "how different is the change, and where?" |
| **`replay.py`** | Re-runs a candidate change over real history and scores it (meals caught earlier vs false fires vs sleep fires) — lets us reject unsafe designs before writing dosing code. |
| **`parkes_grid.py`** | Parkes Error Grid of Boost's predicted BG vs the BG that actually occurred — forecast accuracy. |
| **`episode_impact.py`** / `cold_idle_dose_validation.py` | First-order / counterfactual BG-impact estimates around real low/high episodes (open-loop, clamped — not a simulation). |

Worked example — the fast-carb fast-path. A fast carb spike-then-crash was observed where V6 sat
in OBSERVING one cycle too long. Classified *heuristic*. A one-cycle promotion on a sharp
accelerating rise was designed — but replay rejected the obvious rule (it fired during sleep and
~2×/day falsely). Adding corroboration (require the meal score *and* awake *and* not-exercising) gave
zero sleep fires, half the false rate, and still caught ⅓ of meals ~15 min earlier. The replay chose
the safe design before any dosing code was written. A separate proposed cold-IDLE fast-path was
likewise reverted after a full-cohort re-run didn't support it.

## Robustness, in one list

- **Every stock AndroidAPS safety gate is unchanged** — Boost only replaces the SMB decision.
- **Shadow mode is a real execution path**, not a simulation — the same code runs and logs without
  touching the pump, so what you watch *is* what would dose.
- **Auto-config is suggestion-only and only ever tightens safety knobs** — see
  [advanced settings](v6-advanced-settings.md).
- **Caps are layered** — per-shot magnitude caps *and* a rolling-hour cumulative cap.
- **Android and the Trio (Swift) port are kept in numeric parity**, checked line-for-line.
- **What is *not* claimed:** there is no glucose-outcome simulation and no clinical-equivalence pass
  on simulated glucose. The tools validate *decisions and forecasts*, plus real single-user outcomes
  — not a population glucose-outcome guarantee. This is an experimental dosing algorithm; a shadow
  mode (the "Boost" plugin) is available for anyone who wants to watch before going active, but the
  supported path is Boost V6 active, seeded from your own history.

## Testing & evidence

A single developer running V6 active on their own pump for months, plus a small cohort running it
in shadow. This is real-world experience and shadow analysis, not a clinical trial.

Developer's own V6-active glycaemia (honest, full picture):

- **Time in range (70–180): ~85%**, mean ~6.9 mmol/L.
- **Normal weeks: within hypo targets** — TBR<70 ~2.5–3%, severe <54 < 0.5%.
- **High-activity weeks** (multi-day festival / heavy training): hypo above target. The exercise
  lows are the loop's hardest case — most are activity-driven, and the loop's only lever is to
  withhold insulin, which it has often already done. Two July-2026 changes help: the loop now
  suppresses the inactivity insulin-add and lifts the target during elevated-heart-rate exercise, and
  the composed rebound guard prevents the post-rescue confirm-crash. Cohort analysis shows the
  residual post-meal-exercise low is a *carbohydrate-counterweight* effect (exercise's
  insulin-independent glucose uptake landing when the meal's carb flux is thin), not over-dosing —
  the next lever is per-user *anticipatory* insulin withdrawal, which the anticipation shadow is
  banking data toward. Watch this if you run it through heavy exercise.
