/**
 * Classifies exercise type by combining Karvonen Heart Rate Reserve (HRR%) zones
 * with step count signals from StepService.
 *
 * ## Zone definitions (Karvonen HRR%)
 * HRR% = (currentHR - HRrest) / (HRmax - HRrest) * 100
 *
 *   Zone 1 — Very Light :  < 30% HRR  (recovery, rest)
 *   Zone 2 — Light       : 30–40% HRR  (easy aerobic)
 *   Zone 3 — Moderate    : 40–60% HRR  (aerobic conditioning)
 *   Zone 4 — Hard        : 60–80% HRR  (vigorous aerobic / strength)
 *   Zone 5 — Maximum     :  > 80% HRR  (near-maximal effort)
 *
 * ## Combined exercise states
 *
 *   VIGOROUS_AEROBIC  — High steps + Zone 3–5
 *     Effect on T1D: immediate insulin sensitivity increase, hypo risk.
 *     Response: reduce profile %, raise target BG.
 *
 *   MODERATE_AEROBIC  — Moderate steps + Zone 2–3
 *     Effect on T1D: moderate sensitivity increase.
 *     Response: reduce profile % (same as step-only ACTIVE).
 *
 *   LIGHT_AEROBIC     — Steps elevated + Zone 1–2
 *     Effect on T1D: mild sensitivity change.
 *     Response: same as step-only ACTIVE (mild profile reduction).
 *
 *   RESISTANCE        — Low/no steps + Zone 3–4
 *     Effect on T1D: acute BG rise short-term, delayed hypo risk.
 *     Response: raise target BG, do NOT reduce profile % yet.
 *
 *   STRESS            — Low steps + Zone 2–3, no exercise context
 *     Effect on T1D: cortisol/adrenaline raise BG → insulin resistance.
 *     Response: raise target BG (if stress detection enabled).
 *
 *   RESTING           — Normal HR (Zone 1) + low steps
 *   INACTIVE          — Very low steps + normal HR (confirms step-only INACTIVE)
 *
 * This class is intentionally stateless and functional — no side effects, no stored state.
 * Thread safety: all inputs are immutable; safe to call from any thread.
