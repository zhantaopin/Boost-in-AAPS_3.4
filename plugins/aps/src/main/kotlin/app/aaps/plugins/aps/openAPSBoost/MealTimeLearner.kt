/**
 * MealTimeLearner — Boost V6.
 *
 * Learns a user's habitual meal times from the events V5 itself already calls meals (a fresh
 * CONFIRMED commit) and exposes a query the loop uses to fire an anticipatory low temp target
 * 45–60 min before a learned meal. Reuses [SleepHistoryTracker]'s `msToMinOfDay` / `circularMean`
 * so all time-of-day maths is midnight-wrap-safe and consistent with the sleep learner.
 *
 * **Why CONFIRMED events** (decided with Tim 2026-06-15): they are the real, already-computed
 * meal detector — no second detector to tune, and the histogram learns exactly what V5 treats
 * as a meal. The plugin records `decision.mealHypothesis == CONFIRMED && mealHypothesisAge == 0`.
 *
 * Storage shape (StringKey `ApsBoostMealTimeHistory`):
 *   { "events": [ <utcMs>, <utcMs>, ... ] }      // rolling [WINDOW_DAYS] days
 *
 * Clustering: events are projected to local minute-of-day and greedily grouped into *modes*.
 * A mode is emitted only when a cluster has ≥ [MIN_SESSIONS] events spread over ≥ [MIN_DISTINCT_DAYS]
 * distinct days within ±[CLUSTER_HALF_WIDTH_MIN] — so a one-off late dinner can't manufacture a
 * window. The mode centre is the circular mean of its members.
 *
 * Safety posture: empty / corrupt history → no modes → [preMealWindow] returns null → the feature
 * never fires. The learner has ZERO dosing impact on its own; the plugin gates the actual target
 * change behind a user toggle (shadow-first).
