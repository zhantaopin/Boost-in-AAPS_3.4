/**
 * SleepStateDetector — HR + step + clock-driven sleep state estimator for Boost night mode.
 *
 * Three-state machine: AWAKE → PRE_SLEEP → SLEEPING → AWAKE.
 *
 * Design (2026-06-02):
 *
 * Enter PRE_SLEEP (from AWAKE) when:
 *   - clock-of-day ∈ [nightStart − preSleepLeadMin, nightStart)
 *
 *   PRE_SLEEP is a *proactive* state: it engages Boost night-mode SMB suppression BEFORE
 *   the user falls asleep, so they're not carrying excess IOB into the night. No HR or
 *   step gating — this is a time-only pre-warm window.
 *
 * Enter SLEEPING (from PRE_SLEEP or AWAKE, in the ±[SLEEP_SCHEDULE_TOLERANCE_MIN]-early candidate
 * window through nightEnd) when a qualifier holds for ≥ minSleepHysteresisMin — EITHER:
 *   (a) HR-corroborated: avgHr ≤ hrRest × 1.15, stepsLast15Min < 50, mlMealLikely < 0.30/null
 *       (reason "hr"), OR
 *   (b) HR-unreliable fallback: the HR feed is dead OR intermittent (fresh samples < [HR_RELIABLE_MIN_SAMPLES])
 *       and drought is established (≥ droughtThresholdMin, stray samples don't reset it), with the same
 *       step + meal gates — so a degraded overnight feed still reaches SLEEPING on the clock
 *       (reason "drought" if fully dead, "time" if intermittent). 2026-07-08: fixes the stuck-in-PRE_SLEEP
 *       nights where ~1 stray HR sample/15-20min defeated both the old avgHr==null gate and the HR qualifier.
 *
 * Exit SLEEPING (to AWAKE) — BG trend alone NEVER wakes. Any of:
 *   1. Gentle (HR + steps), trusted only within [SLEEP_SCHEDULE_TOLERANCE_MIN] of scheduled wake:
 *      avgHr > hrRest × 1.25 for ≥ [WAKE_HR_SUSTAIN_CYCLES] cycles (REM-proof), AND step evidence
 *      (stepsLast15Min ≥ 100 OR stepsToday growth over [WAKE_STEP_LOOKBACK_MIN] ≥ [WAKE_STEP_THRESHOLD]),
 *      sustained ≥ wakeHrHysteresisMin (reason "hr_steps").
 *   2. Strong steps-alone, ONLY when HR is unreliable (dead/intermittent) so it can't corroborate:
 *      stepsToday growth ≥ [WAKE_STEP_STRONG_THRESHOLD], sustained (reason "steps"). When HR is live,
 *      the gentle rule governs and steps-alone does NOT wake — preserves the both-required guard.
 *   3. clock-of-day exits nightEnd  (hard morning boundary — reason "boundary", excluded from learning).
 *
 * 2026-07-03 incident (why the step evidence is lump-tolerant): the wear step bridge delivers
 * steps in LUMPS, not smooth 15-min increments — the developer was demonstrably awake ~06:00
 * (hrAvg5m 90.2 @05:52, 82–86 through 06:30; wear stepsToday jumped 0 → 1326 by 06:02) yet the
 * detector held SLEEPING until the 07:00 boundary, because the lump predated/straddled the single
 * 15-min bucket and "steps≥100/15min AND HR rise in the same window" never co-fired. Consequences:
 * a 06:02 BG rise to 164 got night-capped dosing for ~1h, and sleepLearnedWakeMin was still NULL
 * after 48 sessions — every wake was boundary-forced, so the wake learner (genuine wakes only, by
 * design) never received a sample. BG alone still NEVER wakes the detector.
 *
 * PRE_SLEEP → AWAKE when clock-of-day exits nightEnd (morning).
 *
 * Failsafes:
 *   - If avgHr is null (no HR data in window), the detector cannot CONFIRM sleep; state
 *     stays AWAKE (or PRE_SLEEP if in time window). Callers should fall back to legacy
 *     time-based night mode.
 *   - State machine is monotonic per-cycle; hysteresis counters carried across calls
 *     via the caller's persistent state struct (see [State]).
