/**
 * Boost V5 auto-configuration — derive sensible initial V5 knobs from the user's own V1 dosing
 * history (default: last 14 days) when they first switch to the Boost V5 plugin.
 *
 * Rationale (see SHADOW_EQUIVALENCE_REPORT): V5's dose calibration is a *heuristic co-adapted with
 * the user*, so the safe onboarding is to **start where their V1 left off**, not on cohort defaults.
 * This computes a conservative, transparent suggestion from their proven dosing + glycaemia.
 *
 * PURE function — no Android / no I/O. The plugin gathers the [V1Profile] and applies + logs the
 * result. It is **suggestion** logic: the caller only writes knobs still at their factory default
 * (never overrides a user who has already tuned them) and surfaces what it set.
 *
 * Design principles:
 *  - **Conservative.** Never auto-RAISE aggression above neutral (1.0); only ease it down for a
 *    hypo-prone history. Safety knobs (HypoCaution, caps) are derived to bound, not to embolden.
 *  - **Carry proven constraints.** maxIOB / bolus cap mirror the user's existing AAPS values.
 *  - **Refine later.** Aggression can only be matched precisely once shadow data exists (paired
 *    V1/V5 cycles); the day-1 value is a gentle starting point, intentionally on the cautious side.
