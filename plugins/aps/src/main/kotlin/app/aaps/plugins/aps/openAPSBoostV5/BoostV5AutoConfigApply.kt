/**
 * Pure helpers for applying a [BoostV5AutoConfig.V5Suggestion] to preferences while respecting any
 * value the user — or a preset (e.g. a pre-seeded keystore/import) — has ALREADY set.
 *
 * Separated from [OpenAPSBoostV5Plugin]'s preference I/O so the invariants Tim cares about are
 * unit-testable: presetting ONE V6 knob must NOT block the others — the preset value is kept and
 * every other unset knob is still configured.
 *
 * ── Per-key resolution (2026-07 fix, field evidence: user H) ──────────────────────────────────
 * The original design used one global "did run" flag plus a raw `sp.contains(key)` presence test.
 * Two field failure modes:
 *  1. Presence false-positives: anything that persists a knob AT its factory default (settings
 *     import, opening the pref dialog and tapping OK) made auto-config skip it forever — the user
 *     never objected, yet kept the stock value (user H: committedCap stuck at factory 0.5 while his
 *     derived value was 1.24).
 *  2. Global one-shot: once the flag was consumed (older build, or carried in via a settings
 *     import), settings ADDED to auto-config later were never derived for existing installs.
 * The fix: each managed knob is tracked individually as RESOLVED once it has either been applied
 * once or been skipped because the user tuned it (stored value differs from the factory default).
 * Insufficient data resolves nothing, so unresolved knobs genuinely retry on later cycles.
 * "User tuned it" now means *value differs from every factory default the key has ever shipped
 * with* — mere presence in storage no longer blocks a suggestion (value == a factory default means
 * nobody objected).
 *
 * ── 2026-07-06 amendments (7-user migration-cohort backtest) ─────────────────────────────────
 *  - Historical factory defaults: the at-factory test must recognise the defaults of EVERY build
 *    era, or a user whose prefs persisted an OLD factory value reads as "user-tuned" and is frozen
 *    at the tightest-ever values (cohort users C/D: committedCap 0.25 / confirmedCap 1.0 /
 *    cumulative 6.0 eras). See [historicalFactoryDefaults].
 *  - The cumulative 60-min cap is recomputed here from the FINAL operative per-shot caps
 *    (kept-or-derived), not taken verbatim from the derivation (cohort user E incoherence).
 *  - TBR raise-guard: a dose-cap RAISE is priced badly for a TBR-heavy user, and value==factory
 *    cannot distinguish "never touched" from "deliberately reverted to factory". See
 *    [TBR_RAISE_GUARD_PCT].
 *  - Every knob's classification is returned as a [Resolution] with a human-readable reason, so
 *    field diagnosis never needs inference again.

     * ── Periodic re-derivation (2026-08-03, rev 2) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
     *
     * Tracks how far each knob's DRIVER has moved and applies that movement to whatever the knob is
     * currently set to — rather than overwriting it with a fresh absolute derivation.
     *
     * Why. A user who raised committedCap from a derived 1.24 to 1.8 was expressing a judgement the
     * formula does not capture. Overwriting it discards that; freezing it means the knob never
     * tracks anything again. Applying the movement keeps both: if TDD then rises 20%, they go to
     * 2.16 and their own +45% offset survives.
     *
     * The load-bearing property: because the knob is scaled by exactly the ratio the derivation
     * moved, `current / derived` is INVARIANT across a re-derivation. The user's offset neither
     * decays nor compounds — only the driver's own movement is tracked. That is also why this
     * needs no notion of who "owns" a knob, and hence no ownership ledger: nothing is ever
     * overwritten, so it never matters whether auto-config or the user set the current value.
     * (rev 1 used an applied-value ledger and was inert on every existing install, because the
     * ledger could only be populated by the onboarding path, which had already run.)
     *
     * Two families, because a ratio is meaningless for a knob with three possible values:
     *  - RATIO knobs (committedCap, confirmedCap) are U quantities that scale with dose size:
     *        proposed = current × (derivedNow / baseline)
     *  - OFFSET knobs (aggression, hypoCaution) are bounded scales stepping by a fixed quantum:
     *        proposed = current + (derivedNow − baseline)
     *  - COMPUTED knobs (cumulative60, primerCap) are not tracked at all — they are recomputed from
     *    the operative per-shot caps exactly as the derivation itself computes them, so they follow
     *    automatically and can never drift out of step with the caps they bound.
     *
     * The baseline is the DERIVED value at the last write, and is only advanced WHEN we write, so
     * movement suppressed by the deadband or held by the raise-guard accumulates rather than being
     * lost. On the very first evaluation there is no baseline, so no TRACKED knob is written — the
     * run records where the derivation currently sits and tracking begins from the next one.
     *
     * The COMPUTED knobs are the exception and CAN be written on that first run: they are not
     * tracked, they are recomputed from the operative caps every time, so if the stored cumulative
     * cap has drifted out of step with `confirmedCap + 2 x committedCap` it is corrected
     * immediately. Observed in the field on 2026-08-04: a first run reported ch=2, both of them
     * computed knobs. That is intended — a budget sized from a cap that no longer applies is the
     * incoherence the 2026-07-06 migration backtest found — but "the first run changes nothing" is
     * NOT true, and was stated as such when this shipped.
     *
     * Note also that cumulative60 passes through the raise-guard when it increases and primerCap
     * does NOT, matching the onboarding path: the primer's safety is its delivery routing rather
     * than a cap.

     * stay resolved. Then the current version is stamped. Idempotent; a fresh install just stamps.

     * Versions: 0 = pre-versioning (everything up to and incl. the promoted 2026-07-06 APK);
