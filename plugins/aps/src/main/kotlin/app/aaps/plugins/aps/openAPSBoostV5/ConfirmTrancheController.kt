/**
 * Splits the confirm commitment in two: part now, the rest ten minutes later if the rise continues.
 *
 * The confirm shot is currently the same size whether the excursion turns out to be 20 mg/dL or 100.
 * Measured over 140 episodes on the development participant, the median delivered at the confirming
 * cycle is 1.45 U for excursions under 30 mg/dL and 1.45 U for those over 75; the only component of
 * the response that scales with what actually happens is the committed holds that follow, and they
 * contribute a median of 0.00 U on the episodes that go nowhere. The confirm cycle carries 61.7 per
 * cent of the insulin delivered in the ninety minutes after a confirm.
 *
 * It cannot be sized correctly at the moment it fires. Separating the episodes that reach 75 mg/dL
 * from those that stay under 30, the trace gives 0.730 at the confirming cycle and 0.893 ten minutes
 * later, a paired gain of +0.162 [+0.066, +0.264]. The gain is front-loaded: one or two cycles are
 * worth more than everything from twenty minutes to forty-five combined. So the design does not need
 * to predict better, it needs to commit less until it knows more, and the knowing arrives fast.
 *
 * The release rule is a logistic on five quantities the loop already holds, derived over 764 confirm
 * episodes from eleven participants with participants held out as folds, so no score came from a
 * rule that had seen that person. It reaches 0.882 [0.849, 0.911] across the population and 0.798 to
 * 0.934 per participant, with no failure case. Coefficients live in
 * backtesting/scripts/2026-08-meal-size-readability/out/tranche_rule.json.
 *
 * Only the threshold is personal. Best values run 0.30 to 0.65 with a median of 0.48 and correlate
 * only -0.32 with a participant's own share of large excursions, so it cannot be inferred and is a
 * per-user knob for auto-config to derive. Raising it withholds more, which is a tightening, so the
 * existing raise-guard semantics already point the right way without modification.
 *
 * This can only deliver less than the engine would without it, never more. A withheld remainder that
 * is never released is insulin not given; the committed cycles that follow are unaffected and remain
 * the size-responsive part of the response.
