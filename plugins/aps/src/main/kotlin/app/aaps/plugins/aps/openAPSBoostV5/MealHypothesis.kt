/**
 * V5 Phase 1.b — MealHypothesis state machine.
 *
 * Persisted across cycles via RT fields (`mealHypothesis: String?`, `mealHypothesisAge: Int?`,
 * and from 2026-05-15 `maxScoreInObserving: Double?`). V4 had no equivalent — meal recognition
 * was implicit in tier-ladder selection. V5 makes the hypothesis a first-class state the
 * algorithm reasons about, then commits doses against.
 *
 * Five states: IDLE → OBSERVING → CONFIRMED → COMMITTED → RECOVERING → IDLE.
 *
 * Transition thresholds are HARDCODED and calibrated against shadow data
 * (`boost_v5_constants_calibration.md` and the 2026-05-15 V5-fixes review). They are NOT
 * user-facing knobs.
 *
 * State persistence is non-trivial (state from prior cycles influences this cycle's decision),
 * so all reset paths are explicit: see [resetIfNeeded].
 *
 * ## 2026-05-15 fixes applied
 *
 * Shadow data review on 2026-05-15 (`boost_2026-05-14_evening_excursion.md`) showed CONFIRMED
 * fired only 4 times across 8 days because the OBSERVING → CONFIRMED predicate required ALL
 * three conditions to hold ON THE SAME CYCLE — but score is volatile cycle-to-cycle and peaked
 * 1–2 cycles before the age gate (CONFIRM_MIN_OBSERVING_AGE=2) opened. By the time age=2 the
 * score had already retreated.
 *
 * Fix: track the max score observed during the current OBSERVING run and use it for the
 * eligibility check, not the instantaneous score. This preserves the age hysteresis (which
 * matters for noise rejection) while allowing brief score peaks to drive the transition.
 *
 * CONFIRM_SCORE also lowered from 0.66 → 0.55 per the recalibration plan (the original
 * calibration was against an idealised cohort; p95 of observed scores in production is 0.532).
 *
 * ## 2026-05-22 Fix 5 — eventualBG peak-tracking
 *
 * 7d validation backtest against the 2026-05-15 evening meal showed Fix 4 (sustainedRise score
 * component) alone wasn't enough: V5's score peak rose from 0.600 to 0.689 with Fix 4, well
 * above the 0.55 threshold, but CONFIRMED still didn't fire. The third predicate condition —
 * `eventualBg > targetBg + 50` — was checked snapshot-only on each cycle, and during the slow
 * meal window the eventualBG forecast peaked at +42 above target (just below the +50 gate)
 * while the high-score window kept retreating elsewhere.
 *
 * Same shape as the score wobble Fix 1 addressed: a value that crosses the bar briefly during
 * OBSERVING but isn't sitting above the bar on the exact cycle the predicate is evaluated.
 *
 * Fix: peak-track `(eventualBg - targetBg)` across the OBSERVING run and check the max against
 * the threshold, mirroring Fix 1's max-score logic. With peak-tracking, the threshold is also
 * lowered 50 → 30 because peak-over-window is naturally higher than snapshot — the original
 * calibration was for snapshot reads.
 *
 * ## 2026-05-26 Fix 6 — single-CONFIRMED-per-session guard
 *
 * Diagnosed from the 2026-05-25 evening meal trace: V5 fired CONFIRMED 4 times in 20 min during
 * a single meal climb, producing 8U of cumulative shadow dose (vs V4.4.2's actual 1.5U, which
 * was already enough to crash BG from 192 → 48 over 1h 40m). Root cause: AAPS re-invokes the
 * V4.4.2 plugin (and therefore V5's runShadow) every 1-3 min during SMB delivery, not every 5
 * min as the state machine assumes. Combined with the SharedPreferences async-flush race
 * (addressed by V5StateStore's in-memory cache, Fix 6 Part A), the state machine could re-enter
 * OBSERVING after CONFIRMING and re-CONFIRM in the same meal.
 *
 * Fix: persist a `committedInSession` flag through CONFIRMED / COMMITTED / RECOVERING. The
 * OBSERVING → CONFIRMED transition predicate now requires `!committedInSession`. Reset to false
 * only on the RECOVERING → IDLE exit (session complete) or fresh OBSERVING entry from IDLE.
 *
 * Defense in depth: even if the state-persistence race resurfaces, the cached state's
 * committedInSession flag blocks a second commit-shot for the same meal.
