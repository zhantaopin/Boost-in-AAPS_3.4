/**
 * Residual-pool regime — the debiasing fix for foundation-report acceptance criterion (b).
 *
 * The offline substrate (backtesting/reports/2026-07_v7_foundation_REPORT.md §1) showed a
 * systematic +12..+38 mg/dL median residual at 60 min because unannounced-carb absorption lives
 * in the IOB-only residual, and the offline "quiet" regime (defined purely by V5 state) still
 * contained unannounced meal ONSETS (rising IDLE/OBSERVING cycles), so the bias survived regime
 * conditioning. The revised on-device pools therefore condition on V5 state + CGM DYNAMICS + hour:
 *
 *  - [MEAL]       — V5 meal-session states (CONFIRMED/COMMITTED/RECOVERING): absorption is
 *                   expected in the residual, by construction.
 *  - [NIGHT]      — non-meal cycles outside 07:00–22:59 local (matches the backtest's day split).
 *  - [QUIET_FLAT] — non-meal daytime cycles that are ALSO flat by CGM dynamics
 *                   (|delta| and |shortAvgDelta| ≤ [V7ResidualTracker.FLAT_DELTA_5M]).
 *
 * Non-meal daytime cycles that are NOT flat (the unannounced-onset pollution the report
 * identified) fit no pool and are EXCLUDED — both from pooling and from sizing (the shadow logs
 * pool="excluded" and abstains). Criterion (b) is met when the QUIET_FLAT 30-min median residual
 * (`boostV7_q50Drift`) reads ≈0 in the field.
 */

/**
 * V7ResidualTracker — the on-device substrate for the V7 shadow (Transplant-1 substrate, GO per
 * the 2026-07 foundation report; the SIZING rule built on it was NO-GO and is instrumented
 * read-only by [V7Shadow]).
 *
 * Each cycle it records the IOB-only projection at h ∈ {30, 60, 90} min. Since 2026-07-27 the
 * projection is oref's decaying-activity IOB prediction curve (rT.predBGs.IOB — the purple
 * IOB-only line), passed in by [V7Shadow]. The original substrate held the INSTANTANEOUS
 * activity constant over the horizon (projBG = bg + BGI5 × h/5), which overstates the fall in
 * proportion to IOB; field calibration 2026-07-27 showed the resulting pLow90 error is monotone
 * in IOB (high-IOB tertile predicted 36% vs 14% realised; low-IOB 9% vs 27%) and the QUIET_FLAT
 * 30-min median residual sat at +15 mg/dL instead of ≈0 — a bias the regime pools cannot absorb
 * because they are not IOB-conditioned. SERIAL_VERSION bumped 1→2: the residual definition
 * changed, so persisted v1 pools deserialize to a cold tracker and re-warm (~3-6 days). When a horizon matures (a later cycle lands inside the maturation
 * window), residual = observed − projected is added to the pool keyed by the REGIME AT
 * PROJECTION TIME ([V7Regime] — the criterion-(b) debiasing). Pools are windowed (~21 days,
 * size-capped) and expose empirical quantiles (numpy-style linear interpolation, matching the
 * offline scripts) plus counts. Cold pools (< [WARM_MIN_SAMPLES]) return null — consumers abstain.
 *
 * Persistence follows the V5StateStore idiom: a single JSON blob in a StringKey, cached
 * in memory by the orchestrator ([V7Shadow]) so rapid multi-invokes never read stale state;
 * the pref write is only restart recovery. Corrupt state deserializes to a fresh tracker
 * (cold start — fails safe: the sizer abstains until pools re-warm).
 *
 * Multi-invoke handling: AAPS invokes the engine up to every 1–3 min during SMB delivery. A
 * projection recorded in the same 5-min bucket as the previous one REPLACES it (the final
 * invoke of the cycle wins — the same dedup rule as the offline loader), and maturation fills
 * each horizon at most once.
