/**
 * Fix 7 (2026-06-12) — multi-phase meal re-engagement.
 *
 * On a two-phase meal the mid-meal deceleration sends COMMITTED → RECOVERING; RECOVERING previously
 * had no path back to active dosing, so V5 dribbled at 0.4× through the whole second climb (BG ran
 * to 192). Fix 7 adds a RECOVERING → COMMITTED transition when the meal genuinely re-accelerates
 * while still well above target. [step] is a pure function, tested directly.
